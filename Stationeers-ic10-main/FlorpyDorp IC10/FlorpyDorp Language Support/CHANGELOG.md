### FlorpyDorp Era 1.0 Changes

## ✨ Features
- HASH() in defines now behaves like a number everywhere
  - `define StartButton HASH("StructureButton")` resolves to a numeric constant
  - Hover/inlay hints show friendly names and values consistently

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed LSP crash on startup caused by querying a non-existent `function_call` node
  - Uses `hash_preproc` (as defined by the grammar) for HASH detection/inlays
- Eliminated “Cannot call write after a stream was destroyed” during restarts
  - Guarded client restarts and queued config/diagnostic notifications until the server is running
- Restored operand typing for `hash_preproc` so HASH operands are treated as numbers
- Diagnostics toggle more reliable; reduces stale squiggles and avoids mid-shutdown writes

## 🔧 Developer Notes
- Added targeted regression test for HASH defines recognition
- Updated extension client to await `start()` instead of using `onReady()`
