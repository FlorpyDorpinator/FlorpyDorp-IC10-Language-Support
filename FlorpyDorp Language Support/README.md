## 🚀 Intelligent Completions

![Auto-completion Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorpyDorpinator/FlorpyDorp-IC10-Language-Support/main/FlorpyDorp%20Language%20Support/images/completion-demo.gif)

The extension provides context-aware completions that understand what you're typing:

**Smart Filtering:**
- LogicType/BatchMode parameters show ONLY their predefined constants
- Register parameters show registers and your aliases
- Device parameters show device references
- Branch instructions show ONLY labels
- Batch instructions (lb, lbn, lbs) suggest HASH() for device parameters

**Device Completions in HASH():**
Type `HASH("")` and see all 1709 device names with fuzzy filtering:
- Example: `HASH("Struct")` shows StructureVolumePump, StructureBatterySmall, etc.
- Display format: `DeviceName → DisplayName (HashValue)`
- Case-insensitive search
- Only triggers inside HASH(""), not for completed calls

**Usage-Based Sorting:**
Completions prioritize items you've already used:
- Registers (r0-r17) that appear earlier float to top
- Devices (d0-d5) used in your code come first
- Your aliases and defines appear before unused items

**Automatic Triggers:**
- Space after instruction: Parameter completions appear
- Quote in HASH(): Device names appear instantly
- Empty LogicType/BatchMode: Dropdown shows automatically

## 🎯 Branch Visualization

![Branch Visualization Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorpyDorpinator/FlorpyDorp-IC10-Language-Support/main/FlorpyDorp%20Language%20Support/images/branch-visualization-demo.gif)

Visualize control flow with color-coded branch indicators:

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Arrows**: ⇑ (upward) / ⇓ (downward) at branch source lines
- **Dots**: ● marking branch target lines
- **Color Coding**: Each branch gets a unique color (yellow, purple, cyan, orange, pink, lime)
- **Ghost Text**: Shows target line and code preview at end of source line
  - Example: ` ⇑ line 17: l r0 d0 On` (shows you're branching to line 17)

**Smart Highlighting:**
- **Source lines**: Lighter background (shows where branch originates)
- **Target lines**: Darker background (shows where branch lands)
- **Split highlights**: When multiple branches share a line, each segment shows correct opacity
- **Depth assignment**: Shorter branches appear leftmost, longer branches rightmost

**Perfect for:**
- Understanding complex loops and conditionals
- Debugging branch logic
- Visualizing state machines
- Learning IC10 control flow patterns

**Toggle on/off:**  
Press **Ctrl+Alt+B** to show/hide branch visualization anytime.

## 💡 Inlay Hints (Shadow Text)

![Inlay Hints Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorpyDorpinator/FlorpyDorp-IC10-Language-Support/main/FlorpyDorp%20Language%20Support/images/inlay-hints-demo.gif)

See helpful context as you code without obscuring your text:

**Parameter Type Hints:**
- Shows expected parameter types as you type an instruction
- Example: Type `add` → see ` dest a b` in gray shadow text
- Disappears immediately when you start typing parameters
- Never interferes with cursor position or typing flow

**Device Name Hints:**

![Device Hash Hints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorpyDorpinator/FlorpyDorp-IC10-Language-Support/main/FlorpyDorp%20Language%20Support/images/device-hash-demo.gif)

- HASH() calls show device display name and hash value at end of line
- Example: `HASH("StructureVolumePump")` → shows ` → Volume Pump (-1258351925)`
- Numeric device hashes show friendly names
- Example: `-1258351925` → shows ` → Volume Pump`
- Only appears for complete, valid device hashes
- Helps identify devices at a glance

**Smart Behavior:**
- Appears ahead of cursor, never covers what you're typing
- Updates in real-time as you write
- Helps learn instruction signatures and device names naturally

## 🩺 Error Detection & Diagnostics

![Error Detection Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorpyDorpinator/FlorpyDorp-IC10-Language-Support/main/FlorpyDorp%20Language%20Support/images/diagnostics-demo.gif)

The extension catches common mistakes:

**HASH() Validation:**
- `HASH("123")` shows error: "Cannot be a number. Use hash value directly: 123"
- Prevents putting numeric hash values inside HASH()

**Relative Branch to Label Warning:**
- `breq r0 0 labelName` shows warning: "Do you REALLY want to use relative branch here?"
- Quick-fix converts to absolute: `beq r0 0 labelName`
- Critical: Relative branches use the numeric value at the label, NOT the label's line number
- Prevents script-breaking bugs

**Code Limits:**
- Line, column, and byte-limit validation
- 4096-byte warning as you approach the IC10 limit
- Add `#IgnoreLimits` to suppress during development

---

## ⚡ Quick Actions & Refactoring

![Code Actions Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorpyDorpinator/FlorpyDorp-IC10-Language-Support/main/FlorpyDorp%20Language%20Support/images/code-actions-demo.gif)

The extension provides intelligent code actions to improve your workflow:

**HASH Conversion Refactoring:**
- **String to Number**: Right-click on `HASH("StructureVolumePump")` → Refactor → "Convert to hash number: -1258351925"
- **Number to String**: Right-click on `-1258351925` → Refactor → "Convert to HASH(\"StructureVolumePump\")"
- Bidirectional conversion for all 1709 recognized devices
- Appears in "Refactor..." submenu (not quick-fix)

**Branch Conversion Quick-Fixes:**
- **Relative to Absolute**: `breq r0 0 label` → lightbulb → "Change to absolute branch (beq)"
- **Absolute to Relative**: `beq r0 0 123` → lightbulb → "Change to relative branch (breq)"
- Prevents common mistake of using relative branches with labels

**Register Diagnostic Suppression:**
- Click lightbulb on register diagnostic → "Ignore diagnostics for r0"
- Adds `# ignore r0` comment to suppress false positives
- Useful for complex control flow that static analysis can't follow
- Hotkey: **Ctrl+Alt+I** to suppress all register diagnostics at once

---

## 📚 Hover Documentation

![Hover Documentation Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorpyDorpinator/FlorpyDorp-IC10-Language-Support/main/FlorpyDorp%20Language%20Support/images/hover-demo.gif)

Hover over any instruction to see:

- A category (Arithmetic, Control Flow, Device I/O, Batch Ops, etc.)
- A full description
- 3 or more examples (simple → intermediate → advanced)
- Syntax-highlighted IC10 code
- Related instruction references
- Register operation history for clarity

This turns the editor into a live IC10 reference.

## 🧩 Instructions for Mods

Some mods add IC10 instructions. The extension learns them from an `ic10-instructions.json` file.

**Where it finds the files:**

1. **The mods enabled in your game.** The extension reads the game's `modconfig.xml`.
2. **`ic10-lint.json`** in your workspace: each package in its `"extensions"` list that names a file with `"ic10Instructions"` in its `package.json`.
3. **The VSCode `ic10.lsp.instructionFiles` setting**: any other files.

The file the first source gives wins; the **IC10 Mod Instructions** output channel lists where each
instruction came from.

**For mod authors:** ship `ic10-instructions.json` in your mod's folder. The extension's JSON schema
checks it as you edit. Its `"name"` shows in each instruction's hover, as "From the mod …".

```json
{
  "name": "Example Math",
  "instructions": {
    "avg": {
      "description": "Puts the average of a, b and (if given) c into r?.",
      "operands": [
        { "name": "dest", "type": "r?", "role": "write" },
        { "name": "a", "type": "r?|num" },
        { "name": "b", "type": "r?|num" },
        { "name": "c", "type": "r?|num", "optional": true }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | What the operand takes, as the game's help writes it: `r?`, `num`, `int`, `d?`, `logicType`, `slotLogicType`, `batchMode`, `reagentMode`, `str`, joined with `\|`. |
| `role` | `read` (the default), `write` (the register it sets: the first operand only) or `jump` (where it jumps to). |
| `optional` | It can be left off. Optional operands come last. |
| `flow` | `jump` (like `j`), `branch` (like `beq`), `call` (like `jal`), `return` (like `j ra`) or `halt` (like `hcf`). Leave it out for an instruction that runs on to the next line. |

---

## 🔧 Settings

You can customize behavior using these settings:

| Setting                  | Description                     | Default |
